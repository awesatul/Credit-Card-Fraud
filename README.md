# Problem Statement:The use of credit card is increasing day by day and so is the fraud associated with it. Many cases of credit card frauds are happening day by day.so from a banker’s perspective it becomes important to stop the fraudulent transaction as banks cannot afford to lose customers money to fraudsters. Our aim is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning model.
                             The given data set includes credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. Out of a total of 2,84,807 transactions, 492 were fraudulent. This data set is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for just 0.172% of the total transactions. The data set has also been modified with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to maintain confidentiality. Apart from ‘time’ and ‘amount’, all the other features (V1, V2, V3, up to V28) are the principal components obtained using PCA. The feature 'time' contains the seconds elapsed between the first transaction in the data set and the subsequent transactions. The feature 'amount' is the transaction amount. The feature 'class' represents class labelling, and it takes the value 1 in cases of fraud and 0 in others.
